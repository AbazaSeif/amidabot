# AmidaBot
A Discord Bot written in PHP

  <p><code>a~</code> is the bot's prefix
  <br><br><code>a~help</code> Lists all commands
  <br><code>a~ping [url]</code> Ping pong response or ping url
  <br><code>a~8ball</code> Classic 8-Ball
  <br><code>a~webresponse</code> Returns webservers input
  <br><code>a~dice [number]</code> Rolls random number between set number
  <br><code>a~whoami</code> Lists details about the bot

Web response is a simple command which alters a variable set in a file, which is then read by a PHP website. Simple really, but useless.

To run this you will need to install the Discord PHP library: https://discordphp.readme.io/docs/getting-started

And thats pretty much it really. This also includes the webresponse website. This is an old project, the library doesn't work half the time due to it being undermaintained.

If you need help im always online either on Twitter (@ffsamida) or Steam (amidx)
